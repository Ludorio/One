# One

Fisrt try to make a static site with hugo


- Install hugo with `sudo apt install hugo`

- Create the main folders and file with `hugo new site . --force`

- Get a ultra basic and minimal theme from `https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/hugo-starter-theme`: I used his example site as my main site called One.
